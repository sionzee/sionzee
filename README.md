## 👋 Hi there! I'm Sionzee

I'm a software project lead developer with a passion for creating and collaborating on exciting projects. Currently, I’m focused on building my personal projects, especially **Mickle**.

### 🚀 About Me
- 💻 **Day Job:** Lead Developer
- 🌱 **Currently Learning:** Flutter & Rust (beginner level)
  - **Why Rust?** It’s an incredibly safe language with compile-time checks, ownership, and no garbage collection. It's challenging but rewarding to learn, especially the concept of borrow checking.
  - **Why Flutter?** Flutter offers a cross-platform solution without relying on Electron, making it a great choice for UI development.
- 🛠️ **My Projects:** [Mickle](https://github.com/evobug-com/mickle) and [Mickle Server](https://github.com/evobug-com/mickle-server) (still in the learning & refactoring phase)
  - **Mickle's Goal:** We're aiming to build something big, starting with text, then adding voice, and eventually moving to automation like visual programming.
  - **Name Origin:** "Mickle" comes from an Old English word meaning large in amount or quantity.
- 👥 **Looking For:** Collaborators who are interested in contributing to Mickle – it's meant to be a community-driven project! Check out [evobug.com](https://evobug.com) for more details (more updates coming soon).
- 📚 **Languages I'm Studying:** English (I’ve even enrolled in paid English classes!)

### 🔍 Fun Facts
- 🎯 **Most Rewarding Experience:** Gaining the trust of my team. We believe in each other, which helps us achieve great things together.
- 💡 **Programming Philosophy:** Don't be afraid to ask "dumb" questions – it’s better to be temporarily confused than permanently ignorant. Embrace refactoring; each iteration brings you closer to a better result.
- ⚙️ **Technologies I Use:** Typescript is a staple in my daily work, where I develop a WYSIWYG editor with AI and automation for a law company.
- 🔧 **Challenges Faced:** Building Mickle and Mickle Server has been tough due to its scale, need for optimization, and user experience considerations. The journey includes complex tasks like encrypting UDP and making multi-threaded TCP TLS servers with shared memory access.

### 🏆 Other Contributions
- Proud contributor to **Avvoka Editor** (my job) and many small apps done just for fun!

### 🎯 Future Goals
- **In 2024:** I aim to release a public version of Mickle and deliver better, scalable solutions at my job.
